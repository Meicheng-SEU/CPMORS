# CPMORS

In the present study, we aimed to develop and validate an AI model, called CPMORS (Conformal Predictor for MOrtality Risk in Sepsis), to assess the risk of in-hospital sepsis mortality in ICU admissions. We expected the model to provide confidence measures to monitor predictions and flag uncertain predictions at a customized confidence level for human intervention, as well as to provide interpretable risk factors. Through combining model explanation and uncertainty analysis, we aimed at improving the translation of AI-assisted sepsis prediction systems into medical practice and enable intensivists to use them in clinical decision-making.
